			<p>According to some estimates, more than 120 million people lost their jobs and incomes immediately after the lockdown was ordered on March 24. And, about half of the country’s population of 1.38 billion is likely to have been impoverished, with many approaching starvation levels.</p>
			<p class="bg-light font-weight-bold p-3 text-success">"The WHO Country Office for India (WCO India) has been working closely with the Government of India (GoI) to step-up preparedness and response measures for COVID-19, including surveillance and contact tracing, laboratory testing, risk communications and community engagement, hospital preparedness, infection prevention and control, and implementation of containment plan at all three levels of the health system – national, state and district.  The entire field presence, including the National Public Health Surveillance Project, consisting of more than 2000 personnel has been fully re-purposed to support the government to overcome this challenge."

The meteorological department termed the cyclone to be an “extremely severe cyclonic storm” that made landfall in both the states with abundant rains, gust windows and lightning, destroying everything that came in its way, leaving chilling visuals all around.

			<p class="bg-light">The year which has broken the COVID havoc on the country and the world, has brought along a series of unfathomable tragedies. 2020 has become the highlight of the most tragic times being experienced by all of us. Enter another significant environmental tragedy, which has hit the state of Uttarakhand in Northern India, in what has now become a respite-less struggle for the fire fighters controlling the raging forest fires in the state.</p>
			<p class="bg-light">Most of the Northern India is undergoing severe to very severe ranges of the heatwave, with the plains recording above 40 degrees of temperature and hills above 30. According to the meteorological norms, any temperature five degrees above these benchmarks, in these geographical setups, can lead to the conditions conducive of igniting fires. These fires could rage uncontrollably, if the moisture in the air remains negligible with dry spells around.

			The current weather conditions, amid the heatwave spell are proving to be conducive of forest fires to rage on across an expanded area, despite continuous efforts to douse the same.</p>

			<p>The 2020 Assam gas and oil leak, also referred as Tinsukia gas leak or Baghjan gas leak, is a petroleum gas and oil leak that happened in Oil India Limited's Baghjan Oilfield operated by John Energy Pvt Ltd in Tinsukia district, Assam, India on 27 May 2020. It occurred due to failing pressure systems in the oil well.</p>
			<p class="bg-light font-weight-bold p-3 text-success">"On the day India was expressing outrage over the killing of a pregnant elephant in Kerala’s Palakkad district, an oil well exploded in Baghjan, Assam, near the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park, releasing a continuous stream of natural gas into the atmosphere.The leak resulted in two deaths, and the displacement of over 3,000 local people, yet there has been a deafening silence about the incident in mainstream media.

			The oil leak has failed to get the kind of coverage that the Vizag gas leak received. The chemical leak from the LG Polymers plant in Visakhapatnam on 7 May, which killed at least seven people and triggered panic in the industrial coastal city, caused widespread anguish and even evoked comparisons with the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy."
